        "question": "Do I need to install any app?",
        "answer": "No. Chequi works entirely in the web browser, for both administrators and scanners. You just need internet access and a smartphone or computer with a camera to scan QR codes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it work without internet connection?",
        "answer": "Yes. The scanner module has offline mode that stores scans locally and syncs them automatically when you regain connection. Ideal for events in places with limited connectivity."

      {
        "question": "How many devices can I connect simultaneously?",
        "answer": "Unlimited. You can have as many control points as you need, all synced in real time. Each device can work independently and data is consolidated in the central dashboard."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are QR codes secure?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Each QR code is unique and non-transferable, generated with a 128-bit random token. Additionally, the system validates in real time and detects reuse or duplication attempts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize tickets?",

      {
        "question": "Is there an attendee limit?",

        "question": "What reports are included?",

        "question": "Can I import my attendee list?",

        "question": "What if I need to make last-minute changes?",
